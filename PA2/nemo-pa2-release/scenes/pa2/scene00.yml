# A list of particle pairs, between which there will be gravitational force applied.
# The gravitational force (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) is
# defined in the course note.
# Here each pair of particles may even experience different G (newton's constant)
gravitational:
  # 1st spring
  # particle_ids are a pair of Ids indidcating which particles this spring
  # connects to. The Ids are zero-based (the first particle listed above has
  # an ID=0).
  - particle_ids: [0, 1]
    G: 100.  # Newton's constant for gravitational force
